# CodeLexicon
 
Code Lexicon is a project that I tried to gather English article from stackoverflows and other technical websites, and then sort the words appeared by frequency, and lastly made as dictionary.
It was a good idea to me, but the problem is the top 50 words are so limited to simple words like "it" or "software". I hope someone will find a better way.
